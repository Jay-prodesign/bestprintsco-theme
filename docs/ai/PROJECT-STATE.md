- Runtime themes verified read-only: `130378989648` MAIN/Active; `130374139984` UNPUBLISHED/Draft.
- API version: `2026-07`; model: Sol; activation UTC: `2026-07-22T14:25:22Z`.
- CAT-BACKUP-001 remains DONE. Corrective publication artifact `1ftIqQbEmKW4EykaXhwt19dbj_9YCyVHd`; 17/17 sample PASS; pagination complete; restore fixture PASS; unexplained differences 0.
- Fresh CAT-MEDIA prepared scope: 16 ACTIVE products / 46 exact links, all present; 0 exclusions; complete pagination.
- Pilot: product `6827404427344`, handle `mandala-handcrafted-white-sole-sneakers-2`; detached variant `40130542862416` from media `23339769135184`.
- Shopify mutation count: 1; userErrors: 0. Only the approved association changed. Full protected-field, media, publication and storefront QA passed; unexplained differences 0.
- Rollback validated and available; not applied. No scaling or downstream job started.
- Residual risk: the remaining 45 prepared links have not been freshly checkpointed for mutation in a later run.
- Next action: Continue CAT-MEDIA-001 with Terra at the next safe checkpoint using the exact same approved rule and all unchanged gates.
